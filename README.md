Welcome to my personal projects, this repo consists of projects I've completed outside of school courses and includes programs that I've used to explore new 
languages and aspects of computer science!


TLDR of projects

1) HTML JS Fighting Game
	
	This 2D arcade style fighting game was created in conjunction with an online course about Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This online game uses free 
  online sprites and the GSAP Javascript library to handle simiple animations. This is my first introduction to front end development and I 
  used this project to familiarize myself with Javascript and how it works in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create fast and responsive websites and web applications.
  
2) Arctic Prediction and Analysis Algorithm and Write up

	Final linear algebra project submission. This python notebook takes 15 years of daily ice extent values from the Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent (MASIE) Northern Hemisphere Project. This writeup analyzes this data by creating a correlation matrix and using linear regression to highlight and predict present and future changes in the sea ice extent of 17 different regions in the Northern Hemisphere.

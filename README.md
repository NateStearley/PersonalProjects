Welcome to my personal projects, this repo consists of projects I've completed outside of school courses and includes programs that I've used to explore new 
languages and aspects of computer science!


TLDR of projects

1) HTML JS Fighting Game
  This 2D arcade style fighting game was created in conjunction with an online course about Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This online game uses free 
  online sprites and the GSAP Javascript library to handle simiple animations. This is my first introduction to front end development and I 
  used this project to familiarize myself with Javascript and how it works in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create fast and responsive websites and web applications.
